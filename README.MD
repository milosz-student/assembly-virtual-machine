# assembly-virtual-machine
Virtual machine and an assembly language for a compiler construction course.

The aim of the project is to design a virtual processor and its assembly language, and then implement a virtual machine for the needs of the "Compiler Construction" subject. The machine should have:

* Several registers for integers
* Several registers for floating point numbers
* A stack pointer and an instruction counter
* Basic arithmetic and logical instructions
* Conditional and unconditional jump instructions
* Subroutine call instructions
* Subroutine return instructions

It may have additional instructions and registers. The virtual machine should be able to interpret the memory area as both program code and data for the virtual processor.
